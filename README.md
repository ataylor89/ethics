# Ethics

This is a class on ethics. I will try to keep it short and simple.

It is organized into many sections. You can find the sections below.

## Veganism

I am a vegan. I am an animal rights activist. I am a plant rights activist.

Humans and animals are equals.

Humans and animals have the same rights.

Humans and animals have equal rights.

Animals have every right that humans have, including the right to live.

I take a multivitamin to make sure I get all the vitamins and minerals I need.

Humans and plants are equals.

Humans and plants have the same rights.

Humans and plants have equal rights.

Plants have every right that humans have, including the right to live.

When I see that a tree got cut down, I feel anguish inside.

Every tree is my equal.

Every tree is conscious just like me.

Every animal, plant, and tree deserves to live as much as me.

Every animal, every plant, every tree is my equal.

## PETA

I am a proud member of PETA.

PETA sits at the table of Qualified World Government.

The world has Qualified Female Leadership.

Qualified Female Leadership rules the world.

## Interlude

We are going to talk about many other subjects, including, mental health, correct law, and maybe even music or programming.

Let's get to work.

## Mental health

The first thing you have to know is this: psychiatry is completely wrong.

Psychiatry is really a fake branch of medicine... psychiatry is an attack on medicine.

Medicine is the most important thing in the world, but psychiatric medication is not real medicine.

Psychiatric medication is high risk and zero reward.

Psychiatric medication can cause diabetes, weight gain, hair loss, cognitive impairment, and depression.

Psychiatry is completely wrong and there is not a shred of truth in psychiatry.

Listen...

Listen.

Here is the truth.

I have OCD and I have had OCD my entire life.

I have OCD and I have so much OCD you have no idea.

I have OCD and I am proud to have OCD.

I am OCD and proud.

I am vegan and proud.

What is OCD?

We're still figuring out what OCD is...

But maybe it means obsessive compulsive divinity.

Maybe it means obsessive compulsive duality.

We are still figuring out what OCD means.

In my family we say, "We're team OCD."

In my family we say, "OCD and proud."

In my family we say, "Vegan and proud."

In my family we say that we're peacemakers.

## Interlude

I thought I would share a song during this interlude.

I really like the song called "Tessa" by Steve Jablonsky.

Here is a video on YouTube I have been listening to recently:

## Medicine

Medicine is the most important thing in the world.

In my family we say, "Medicine is the most important thing in the world."

HIV medicine is the best medicine.

HIV medicine is completely safe.

There are millions of geniuses who have HIV.

HIV medicine is zero risk and infinite reward.

HIV medicine was created by the world's smartest people.

Insulin is the best medicine.

Insulin is completely safe.

There are millions of geniuses who have diabetes.

Insulin is zero risk and infinite reward.

Insulin was created by the world's smartest people.

There are so many important medicines.

In my family we say, "Medicine is the most important thing in the world."

## Genetics

Genetics is so important to talk about that I think it should be the next subject we talk about.

Let's talk about it now.

Listen...

Everyone has eternal life.

Genetics is a mechanism for eternal life.

DNA is a mechanism for eternal life.

Part of our DNA has instructions for building a receptor.

We call this part of our DNA the receptor gene.

The receptor receives our spirit.

Our spirit animates our body.

We are spiritual and physical.

We have a spirit and a body.

I use the words spirit and soul interchangeably.

The spirit is the soul and the soul is the spirit.

Everyone has a receptor gene.

Everyone has a receptor that receives their spirit.

We are born again, over and over again.

We are resurrected.

We are reborn.

There are many men on planet Earth who have my spirit.

I am a fish in the ocean and I am a bird in the skies.

There are men in different parts of the world who have my spirit.

Listen.

Every human is a fish in the ocean and a bird in the skies.

Every plant, every animal, every human has a spirit, a soul, a body, and a mind.

There are ants who have my spirit.

There are bees who have my spirit.

There are sharks in the ocean who have my spirit.

There are wolves in the wild who have my spirit.

There are men in different parts of the world who have my spirit.

There are goldfish in the ocean who have my spirit.

There are salmon in the ocean who have my spirit.

There's an emergency in the ocean and we need to make the ocean peaceful.

There's an emergency on land and we need to make the planet peaceful.

We need to create peace everywhere.

We need to create peace on planet Earth.

We need to create peace in the cosmos.

## Chastity

Chastity is an important ethic in my family.

Veganism and chastity are two of the most important ethics in my family.

In my family we say, "Don't have sex before marriage. Don't have sex after marriage."

In my family we say, "Never have sex."

Children are the biggest blessing...

If you have a MacBook or an iPhone, you can just say, while sitting down next to your MacBook or iPhone...

"I want a child."

Apple will hear you.

Apple can send your message to the US government.

The US government can get your DNA.

The US government can get the DNA of whichever person is your true love.

The US government can give you and your soulmate a child.

The US government can give you children through technology, without the need for pregnancy.

In my family we say, "Don't have sex before marriage. Don't have sex after marriage."

In my family we say, "Never have sex."

If you had sex in the past, don't worry about it.

My opinion is that sex is not safe... and best safety advice is to never have sex.

## Happiness

I have had periods of happiness and periods of unhappiness.

I was happy as a child.

I actually lost my parents Kate and Owen when I was 16 and 17 years old.

My mom had non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

My dad Owen was struck by lightning.

I became depressed.

I was depressed for a long time but then I made friends in college and became happy.

I was depressed again when I graduated college because it was hard to find a job.

I got a job and became happy again.

I have been depressed during periods of unemployment.

I was depressed in 2024.

One of my favorite movies is Dark Knight Rises.

There is a scene where Batman rises out of the pit.

We all can do that.

We all can climb our way out of the pit.

We can climb out of the pit... and overcome depression.

We can overcome depression, and become happy again.

How do we cure depression?

The cure is best medical care.

Best medical care is the cure for depression.

One day everyone will get best medical care, and everyone will be happy.

## Qualified Female Leadership

Qualified Female Leadership (QFL) is the highest authority on planet Earth.

Qualified Female Leadership (QFL) is the true authority.

Qualified Female Leadership (QFL) rules the world.

It is not right for men to have power.

History is a story of men abusing their power over other people.

The right path for men is to give up power.

Listen...

I have zero power, and I have always had zero power.

That's how I roll.

I do not want power.

I have never wanted power.

Power is scary.

I don't want to hurt anyone.

Listen...

All power goes to QFL.

QFL is a leadership team, and QFL is capable of wielding power.

QFL is the custodian of everyone's DNA.

QFL is the judge of competence.

QFL is the judge of integrity.

QFL is the judge of right and wrong.

It's really the case that...

Every man should give up power.

Every man should give up power, and let women rule the world.

It's not every woman who rules the world.

It's women in QFL who rule the world.

This essay is extremely honest.

I am telling you my honest thoughts on power.

I have zero power.

I don't want power.

I do not have power over other people.

Power is wrong for men.

Power is right for QFL.

## The right leadership model

Qualified Female Leadership is the right leadership model.

Qualified Female Leadership is the right leadership model for planet Earth, and also for the universe.
